# Stable Set Value Function Project

### Running Experiments
```
julia --project=. run_experiment.jl
```

### Project Structure
```
|-- dat: graph files.
    |-- chordal: chordal graphs generated by RandomChordalGraph() in Sage.
    |-- dimacs: maximum clique problem cases from the Second DIMACS Implementation Challenge. It is advised to use the complement of these graphs for stable set.
    |-- gsg: generalized split graphs generated by generate_generalized_split_graph() in graph_utils.jl.
    |-- miplib: graphs for stable set problem from the MIPLIB 2017 library.
    |-- perfect: currently contains subgraphs of chordal graphs, or modified versions of such, that are found to be interesting in some ways (when used with pre-specified weights in run_experiment.jl, generated by find_bad_valfun()).
    |-- petersen: Petersen graphs generated by GeneralizedPetersenGraph() in Sage.
    |-- random: small random graphs generated by RandomGNP() in Sage. "np": not weakly perfect; "qp": weakly perfect but not perfect (we call it "quasi-perfect"); "p": perfect.
|-- images: graph visualization files.
|-- src
    |-- ValFun: the ValFun module containing functions for defining value functions.
        |-- qstab_valfun.jl: functions for the clique polytope (QSTAB) linear program value function.
        |-- sdp_valfun.jl: functions for the SDP value function proposed by the project.
        |-- valfun_utils.jl: some utility functions, such as for setting solvers for an optimization model.
        |-- valfun.jl
    |-- bad_valfun.jl: functions related to finding a combination of "bad" value function and weights.
    |-- graph_utils.jl: utility functions related to loading, visualizing and generating graphs.
    |-- valfun_algorithms.jl: algorithms that utilize either the QSTAB value function or the SDP value function, including the proposed discarding-picking algorithm and rounding algorithm, as well as functions to test whether a value function is "valid".
    |-- valfun_experiments.jl: functions which are called from command line or from run_experiment.jl to run an experiment on a graph. New experiments should be implemented here.
|-- experiment results.md: a file recording past experiment results (currently only containing those of the DIMACS graphs).
|-- run_experiment.jl: the script that loads a specific graph, specifies a combination of parameters, and runs an experiment.
